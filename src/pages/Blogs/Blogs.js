            How does prototypical inheritance work?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-[#F9D342] text-lg  mt-5">
            prototypical inheritance refers to the ability to access object
            properties from another object. We use a JavaScript prototype to add
            new properties and methods to an existing object constructor. We can
            then essentially tell our JS code to inherit properties from a
            prototype. Prototypical inheritance allows us to reuse the
            properties or methods from one JavaScript object to another through
            a reference pointer function. All JavaScript objects inherit
            properties and methods from a prototype: Date objects inherit from
            Date.prototype. Array objects inherit from Array.prototype. Player
            objects inherit from Player.prototype. The Object.prototype is on
            top of the prototype inheritance chain. â€‹ Date objects, Array
            objects, and Player objects all inherit from Object.prototype.

          <h1 className="text-white text-2xl">
            Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example, if you
            have `const [products, setProducts] = useState([])`. Why you do not
            set `products = [...]` instead, you use the `setProducts`
          </h1>
          <p className="text-[#F9D342] text-lg text-center mt-5">
            useState accepts an initial state and returns two values: The
            current state. A function that updates the state. To update our
            state, we use our state updater function. We should never directly
            update state. Ex: products = [.....] is not allowed. We need
            setProducts to update the state

            You have an array of products. Each object has a name, price,

            first I will use map and pass the each product as a props in Product
            page. Like products.map , Then I will filter the product by name. if
            name===userInput then I will show the all product.

            What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-[#F9D342] text-lg text-center  mt-5">
            The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to
            test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an
            important step in the development process, because if done
            correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more
            difficult to find in later testing stages.
